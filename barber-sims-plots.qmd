## Goal

Goal is to examine the results from the simulations done with 
Barber's python code. I'll read the results csv files into R, 
then create plots for interval widths.
Note also that Barber used 50 replicates per setting in her
simulations.

## R code for plots

I have two results files, one for each of the two training set
sample sizes, 100 and 1000.
Both have test set sizes of 100.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
big_file <- "jackknife_simulation_results-1000.csv"
big_dat <- vroom::vroom(big_file, col_names = TRUE) %>%
                dplyr::mutate(training_sample_size = 1000)
small_file <- "jackknife_simulation_results-100.csv"
small_dat <- vroom::vroom(small_file, col_names = TRUE) %>%
                dplyr::mutate(training_sample_size = 100)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
big_dat %>%
    dplyr::bind_rows(small_dat) %>%
    dplyr::filter(method == "CV+") %>%
    

```
